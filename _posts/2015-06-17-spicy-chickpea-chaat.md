This one is ideally best served on a sunny evening in Eskdale, after having spent at least an hour pitching a new tent. Twice. Preparing this is a lot easier.

#### Ingredients
* 1 Tin of chickpeas (450g)
* 2 Tablespoons of plain yogurt 
* 1/2 onion, finely chopped 
* Plenty of black pepper 
* 1 Teaspoon of tandoori powder 
* 1/2 Teaspoon of chilli powder 
* 1/2 Teaspoon of chilli flakes 
* 1/2 Teaspoon of mint (jar) 
* Juice of 1/2 lemon or lime
* Salt to season 

Mix all the above ingredients in a bowl.

I found the above quantities enough for 3 people as a starter. I can imagine making a large bowlful for diners to help
themselves to before the main courses arrive.
