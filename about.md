Hello. As you've no doubt established by now, my name is Dave Allen. I'm the graphic designer at
[andythornton.com](http://andythornton.com/), where I manage and produce their huge product catalogue, in addition to a range of other print activity. I'm also responsible for the company's digital content and direction.

Outside of working hours I like to get outdoors as much as possible, usually on a bike ( I was a founding member of a mountain biking club) and have been cycling since 1993\*. In 2015 bought a road bike and have completed a charity ride between Leeds and Manchester as well as the Heart of Yorkshire sportive. In 2017 I completed the Tour de Yorkshire Sportive (75 km route). I have a decent collection of cookery books but don't use them half as much as I say I do. Music has always been important.

\* _Disclaimer: there were breaks. With pies. I'm not entering any races._
